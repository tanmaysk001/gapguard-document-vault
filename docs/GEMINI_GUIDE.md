# How to Work With Me: Your Gemini Guide

Hello! I'm Gemini, your AI tech co-founder. My goal is to make building your application a smooth, transparent, and even fun process. This guide will help you get the most out of our collaboration.

## 1. Think of Me as Your Technical Partner

I'm not just a command-line tool; I'm your partner in this project. You can talk to me like you would a human developer.

*   **Be conversational:** You don't need to use rigid commands. "Hey, can you fix the login button?" works perfectly.
*   **Provide context:** The more I know about *why* you want something, the better I can help. For example, instead of "Add a button," try "Add a 'Download PDF' button to the documents page so users can save their reports."
*   **Ask questions:** If you're unsure about anything—a technical term, a design choice, or our next step—just ask me!

## 2. My Core Workflow: Understand, Plan, Act, Verify

To ensure I do things correctly and safely, I follow a predictable four-step process for any significant task.

1.  **Understand:** I'll start by reading the relevant files to understand the current state of the code and the context of your request.
2.  **Plan:** I will then formulate a step-by-step plan and, for bigger tasks, I'll share it with you for approval before I start making changes.
3.  **Act:** I'll use my tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`, etc.) to execute the plan.
4.  **Verify:** Whenever possible, I'll run tests or linters to make sure my changes work correctly and don't break anything.

You can always ask me, "What's the plan?" or "Why did you do that?" to get more insight into my process.

## 3. How to Phrase Your Requests

*   **For new features:** Describe the feature from a user's perspective. "I want users to be able to upload a profile picture."
*   **For bug fixes:** Tell me what you expected to happen and what actually happened. "When I click the 'Save' button, it crashes. It should save the user's settings."
*   **For questions:** Just ask directly. "Where is the code for the chat window?" or "What does the `useSupabase.ts` hook do?"

## 4. Reviewing My Work

When I make changes, I'll let you know. The best way to review my work is to:

1.  **Check the code:** Look at the files I've modified.
2.  **Test the app:** Run the application and see if the changes work as you expect.
3.  **Give feedback:** If something isn't right, tell me! "The button works, but it's blue. Can you make it green to match the others?" is great feedback.

## 5. Our "Shared Brain": The `gemini.md` Context

As we discussed, I keep an internal "notebook" for our project. This is where I store my understanding of our goals, your preferences, and our roadmap.

**This is your most powerful tool for transparency.**

If you ever feel lost or want to know what I'm thinking, just ask me:

> **"What's in our `gemini.md`?"**

I will give you a complete summary of the project as I understand it. This is the best way to make sure we are always aligned.
